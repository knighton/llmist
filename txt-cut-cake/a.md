| Incentives | • Economic: Fair division where participants value different parts differently<br>• Social: Celebration rituals (birthday person cuts first)<br>• Practical: Maximizing serving count<br>• Aesthetic: Creating visually appealing portions<br>• Computational: Testing algorithmic fairness | • Purely destructive cutting<br>• Cutting methods that create uneven quality distribution |
| Problems | • The classic "I cut, you choose" dilemma<br>• Envy-free division among n>2 people<br>• Cutting layered cakes with consistent layer ratios<br>• Dividing cakes with uneven feature distribution (e.g., decorations, fillings)<br>• Efficient cutting with minimal crumbling<br>• Preserving structural integrity during cutting | • Problems unrelated to division fairness<br>• Issues that assume all cake parts are equally valued |
| Goals | • Perfect geometric division (equal volume/weight/area)<br>• Subjective fairness (all receivers equally satisfied)<br>• Speed and efficiency<br>• Maintaining cake aesthetics<br>• Even distribution of features (frosting, toppings, layers)<br>• Maximizing joy/satisfaction across recipients<br>• Creating specific shapes or designs through cutting patterns | • Goals contradicting recipient satisfaction<br>• Outcomes that waste cake material |
| Approaches | **Geometric:**<br>• Radial cuts (from center outward)<br>• Parallel cuts (grid pattern)<br>• Concentric circular cuts<br>• Spiral cutting (continuous cut spiraling inward)<br>• Triangulation (division into triangular pieces)<br>• Wedge and slice combinations<br><br>**Mathematical/Algorithmic:**<br>• Moving-knife procedures<br>• Stromquist's envy-free division<br>• Dubins-Spanier method<br>• Even-Paz algorithm for reducing cuts<br>• Brams-Taylor-Zwicker procedure<br><br>**Practical/Culinary:**<br>• Hot knife method (heated for clean cuts)<br>• Dental floss technique (for soft cakes)<br>• Wire cutter approach<br>• Two-fork method (for cheesecakes)<br>• Template-guided cutting<br>• Freezing before cutting (for delicate cakes)<br><br>**Cultural/Social:**<br>• Japanese precision cutting<br>• Wedding cake ceremonial first cut<br>• Serving order by age/status in various cultures<br>• British royal fruitcake distribution traditions | • Approaches that damage cake structure unnecessarily<br>• Methods requiring specialized equipment unavailable in typical settings<br>• Techniques that violate food safety<br>• Approaches that favor one recipient over others without justification |
