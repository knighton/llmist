## LLM-Enhanced Monitoring Possibilities

### Enhanced Interpretation & Context

1. **Natural Language Querying**
   - Enabling non-technical stakeholders to interrogate system data
   - Complex query construction from simple language
   - Contextual understanding of system relationships
   - Example: "Show me database servers that are running low on memory after the last deployment"

2. **Anomaly Explanation**
   - Narrative descriptions of unusual patterns
   - Contextual interpretation of multiple correlated metrics
   - Historical comparison with similar incidents
   - Example: "Memory usage is 25% higher than normal for a Tuesday, which correlates with the new image processing service deployed this morning"

3. **Holistic System Understanding**
   - Connecting seemingly unrelated metrics across subsystems
   - Understanding causal relationships between components
   - Identifying hidden dependencies
   - Example: Recognizing that network latency spikes are affecting database performance, causing application timeouts

### Proactive Management
