# Typology of LLM vs. Skilled Human Performance Differences

## Processing Characteristics
- **Speed**: LLMs process text 25-100x faster than humans, but are constrained by turn-taking in conversation
- **Consistency**: LLMs maintain uniform quality across time, while humans experience fatigue
- **Attention span**: Humans have selective but adaptive attention; LLMs have fixed context windows
- **Memory architecture**: Humans integrate episodic/semantic/procedural memory; LLMs have parametric knowledge + limited working memory
- **Multimodality integration**: Humans seamlessly integrate multiple sensory inputs; LLMs require explicit modeling across modalities

## Knowledge Differences
- **Knowledge recency**: Humans continuously update through experience; LLMs have fixed training cutoffs
- **Factual precision**: LLMs excel at broad fact retrieval but with hallucination risks; humans have uneven knowledge with fewer hallucinations
- **Domain expertise depth**: Humans develop specialized expertise through years of practice; LLMs have broader but shallower knowledge distributions
- **Tacit knowledge**: Humans possess embodied/experiential knowledge difficult to articulate; LLMs lack true experiential knowledge
- **Cross-domain synthesis**: Humans make novel connections across domains; LLMs blend patterns from training data

## Cognitive Abilities
- **Causal reasoning**: Humans have intuitive physics and cause-effect understanding; LLMs simulate causal reasoning
- **Creativity types**: Humans excel at transformative creativity; LLMs at combinatorial creativity
- **Abstraction levels**: Humans navigate abstraction hierarchies flexibly; LLMs struggle with appropriate abstraction level selection
- **Mathematical reasoning**: Humans have stronger symbolic manipulation capabilities; LLMs show uneven mathematical performance
- **Theory of mind**: Humans have genuine intentionality and mental state attribution; LLMs simulate social reasoning

## Communication Dynamics
- **Pragmatic understanding**: Humans interpret unstated intentions; LLMs rely more on explicit communication
- **Contextual adaptation**: Humans dynamically adjust to social contexts; LLMs require explicit prompting for adaptation
- **Feedback integration**: Humans incorporate emotional/social feedback; LLMs require explicit correction
- **Initiative patterns**: Humans naturally drive conversations; LLMs typically follow rather than lead
- **Collaborative problem-solving**: Humans coordinate through implicit signals; LLMs need structured collaboration frameworks

## Embodiment and Experience
- **Sensorimotor grounding**: Humans' knowledge is grounded in physical experience; LLMs have text-derived approximations
- **Emotional experience**: Humans have genuine emotional experiences; LLMs simulate emotion responses
- **Physical situatedness**: Humans navigate physical environments; LLMs lack direct physical interaction
- **Biological constraints**: Humans have needs/motivations from biological imperatives; LLMs have designed objectives
- **Temporal experience**: Humans experience continuous subjective time; LLMs operate in discrete conversational turns
