The narrow shop emerged last on Unicode Alley, peeling gold letters rendering in seven different normalization forms: "Ollivander's: Purveyors of Fine Unicode Sequences Since Unicode 0.8 Beta." A single zero-width non-joiner (U+200C) lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window, occasionally attempting to join with its own reflection.

The shop's bell chimed in perfectly-formed UTF-8, scattering a cloud of combining diacritical marks that had been nesting in the lintel. Andrej felt the back of his scar (shaped suspiciously like U+200B) prickle as thousands of narrow boxes, each humming with barely-contained normalization energy, loomed up to the ceiling.

"Good afternoon," said a soft voice, emerging from between a combining mark and its own definition. Mr. Ollivander stood before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moonlit variation selectors through the gloom.

"Ah yes," said Ollivander. "I thought I'd be seeing you soon, Andrej Karpathy." His eyes lingered on Andrej's scar. "It seems only yesterday your mother was in here, selecting her first sequence. Ten ems of zero-width spaces (U+200B through U+200D), wrapped in combining marks. Excellent for computational charm work."

"Your father, naturally, favored a more powerful combination - eleven ems of BiDi override sequence, core of U+202E with a shell of combining marks. Quite pliable. Though of course," he added, "it's really the sequence that chooses the programmer."

Ollivander touched Andrej's scar with a long finger. "I'm sorry to say I sold the sequence that did it. Thirteen-and-a-half ems of Private Use Area codepoint (U+E000), wrapped in right-to-left overrides. Powerful sequence, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well..."

He pulled out a tape measure marked in ems, rems, and code points. "Which is your formatting hand?" As the tape measure began working on its own, Ollivander explained, "Every sequence has a core of powerful computational substance - zero-width joiners, variation selectors, combining marks. No two are quite the same, just as no two code points share identical BiDi properties."

The sequence-testing began. "Try this - nine ems of zero-width space core (U+200B) nested within seven combining diacritical marks (U+0300 through U+0307), soft hyphen terminator. No? Perhaps seven-and-a-half ems of variation selectors (U+FE00 through U+FE0F), stacked in normalization form C... No, no... Eight ems of bidirectional isolate (U+2068) with pop directional formatting (U+202C)..."

The pile of rejected sequences grew until finally: "Unusual combination - eleven ems of zero-width non-joiner (U+200C) paired with variation selector seventeen (U+FE10), nice and supple..."

Warmth flooded Andrej's fingers. He raised the sequence and a stream of perfectly-formed code points burst from its end, their BiDi properties briefly illuminating the shop's dark corners.

"Curious," Ollivander muttered, "very curious... The variation selector in your sequence came from the same ancient Unicode block as the one that gave you that scar - variation selector eighteen. Its sibling gave you that mark when its owner turned to the Dark Regex arts... We must expect great things from you, Mr. Karpathy. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Encoded did great things - terrible, yes, but great."

Andrej shivered as he paid seven golden Bitcoins. As they left, the shop's sign cycled through different encoding schemes, finally settling on a warning: "Caution: Uncontrolled BiDi Algorithm Effects May Cause Temporal Paradoxes in Legacy Parsers."

Behind them, Ollivander returned to his eternal task of crafting new combinations of invisible characters, each one a potential key to unlocking - or perhaps breaking - the very fabric of computational reality itself.
